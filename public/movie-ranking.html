<h1> The Best Movies - Marie's Opinion </h1>
<h2> This is a list of my top 3 favorite movies!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scott Prilgrim vs The World</h3>
<p>I love the concept of this movie. The visual effects and the song Black Sheep, played by The Clash at Demonhead, was really catchy.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>I am not fond of romance movies, but I would watch this masterpiece over and over again.</p>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>I love musicals. Encanto is easily one of my favorite musicals written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. I also love a few of his other musicals such as Hamilton, In The Heights, and Warriors.</p>
